# **C_Beginners – My C Programming Journey 🚀**  

Welcome to my **C_Beginners** repository! This is where I document my learning process as I explore **C programming** from scratch. The goal of this repo is to track my progress, store my practice exercises, and build a solid foundation in C.  

---

## **📌 What You'll Find Here**  
- **Basic Syntax & Structure** – Understanding `main()`, `printf()`, `scanf()`, etc.  
- **Data Types & Variables** – Learning about `int`, `float`, `char`, and more.  
- **Control Flow** – Writing conditional statements (`if-else`) and loops (`for`, `while`).  
- **Functions** – Breaking down code into reusable parts.  
- **Pointers & Arrays** – Exploring memory and efficient data handling.  
- **File Handling** – Reading and writing files in C.  
- **Practice Exercises** – Small programs to reinforce concepts.

## **🚀 How I'm Running My C Programs**  
Since I’m still learning, I use **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)** to compile my C programs.  

### **Compiling & Running a C Program**  
```sh
gcc my_program.c -o my_program
./my_program
```

If you're following along and learning C as well, feel free to check out my progress!
